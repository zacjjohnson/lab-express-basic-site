            Mike Dean is one of the most crucial and prolific behind-the-scenes figures in hip-hop history. Almost strictly a collaborator and facilitator, he's neither a headliner nor a larger-than-life producer. An all-purpose engineer, composer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist, the native Texan has been critical to the early development of rap music from his home state and the South at large, evidenced most visibly by his chart-topping '90s work with Scarface, as well as the rise and sustained prominence of postmillennial stars such as Kanye West and Travis Scott. Due to his work with West, Dean has won five Grammys, highlighted by Best Rap Album awards for Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010). Additionally, his work spans genres, with Beyonc√©, Coldplay, Madonna, and Christina Aguilera all having worked with him. Roughly 40 years after his professional career began in earnest as the keyboardist behind a pre-fame Selena, Dean released his first album, 4:20 (2020), followed by the instrumental 4:22 (2021) and Smoke State 42222 (2022).
